Welcome to the **Task 1** for the **School of Solana Season 5**.

## üìöTask 1
This is your **Task 1** in this course. The primary objective of this task is to help you become familiar with Solana, its underlying principles, and its ecosystem. By completing this task, you will gain an understanding of what Solana is, how it functions, the core concepts it employs, and the broader ecosystem it operates within.

To facilitate your learning, we have prepared the [Solana Handbook](https://ackeeblockchain.com/solana-handbook.pdf). This resource provides a concise introduction to the key aspects mentioned above. For this specific task, the focus is on grasping the Core Concepts of Solana. However, we strongly recommend that you explore the entire handbook. It covers essential aspects of the Solana ecosystem, including the Solana Program Library, the programming model, lucrative programs within the ecosystem, insights into Tokens (Fungible or Non) and their applications, and an introduction to the realm of gaming on Solana.

### Submission Process
This task is structured in a manner similar to the Entry Task, but with distinct questions. As all of you have successfully completed the Entry Task, you should already be acquainted with the submission process. However to avoid any potential misunderstandings and to provide you with a reminder of the process, please note that in this repository, inside the **src** folder, you will find a file named **main.rs.** Within this file, you will find a series of functions structured such that each function corresponds to a specific question. Your task is to update the return values of these functions.


```
/// What is Solana ?
/// a) Dog
/// b) Planet
/// c) Blockchain

‚úÖ Correct
'c'

‚ùå Incorrect
'c)'
'x=c'
'c) Blockchain'
'Blockchain'
'c) c is correct pls give points'
/// 'c'
```

Listing all possible incorrect options would be exhaustive; you understand the idea.

### Deadline
The deadline for this task is **Tuesday, April 17th, at 23:59 UTC**. Note that we will not accept submissions after the deadline.

### Evaluation
To successfully complete this task, you must answer at least **80%** of the questions correctly.


## üë©‚ÄçüíªFurther ...
We understand your eagerness to dive into practical experience with Solana by developing decentralized applications (dApps) and programs. However, it's crucial to begin with a solid theoretical foundation to comprehend the Solana blockchain fully. Think of this as building a strong base before advancing to more practical aspects.

Rest assured, we have a number of programming tasks prepared for you in due course. For now, let's focus on establishing a robust understanding of Solana's theoretical core.

To ensure you are well-prepared for the upcoming programming tasks, we highly recommend installing the fundamental tools for Solana development. Please follow these steps:
- **Install Rust**: Rust is a crucial programming language for Solana development. You can install it from the official Rust website by following this link: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Install Solana CLI Tools**: Solana Command Line Interface (CLI) tools are essential for interacting with the Solana blockchain. You can install them by referring to the official Solana documentation here: [Install Solana](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).
- **Install Anchor**: Anchor is a development framework for building Solana applications. It simplifies the development process. You can install Anchor by visiting the Anchor documentation here: [Install Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation).


If you encounter any questions or issues during the installation process or have any inquiries related to the task, please feel free to initiate a discussion on Discord within the Issues Forum.
